 * Kanye West needs to become president in the year 2020 because he would impact the USA greatly for
 * the better. Through his egotistical state of mind, and ability to compose and produce flawless
 * music for the general public, he will shift America into progressing in the right direction. Some
 * say Bush caused 9/11, I don't 100% agree with that, but I can honestly say Kanye would never do
 * such a thing. Kanye knows the struggle of the average American, he has lived many years as an average
 * American. However, Kanye has not only and blindedly lived many years of privilege, like most of the old, rich, white, Christian
 * presidential candidates have. Kanye will be able to progress America into a better state for all.
 *
 * As always,
 * Kanye West knows best.
